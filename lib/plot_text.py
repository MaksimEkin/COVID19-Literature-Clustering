# project description
description = Div(text="""<p1>Given the large number of literature and the rapid spread of COVID-19, it is difficult for health professionals to keep up with new information on the virus. Can clustering similar research articles together simplify the search for related publications? How can the content of the clusters be qualified? By using clustering for labelling in combination with dimensionality reduction for visualization, the collection of literature can be represented by a scatter plot. On this plot, publications of highly similar topic will share a label and will be plotted near each other. In order, to find meaning in the clusters, topic modelling will be performed to find the keywords of each cluster.
This project is done for <b>Kaggle</b>'s <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge">COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19)</a>.</p1>""")

description2 = Div(text="""<h3>Approach:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Parse the text from the body of each document using Natural Language Processing (NLP). </li>
  <li>Turn each document instance di into a feature vector Xi using Term Frequencyâ€“inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).</li>
  <li>Apply Dimensionality Reduction to each feature vector Xi using t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to cluster similar research articles in the two dimensional plane X embedding Y1.</li>
  <li>Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to project down the dimensions of X to a number of dimensions that will keep .95 variance while removing noise and outliers in embedding Y2.</li>
  <li>Apply k-means clustering on Y2, where k is 20, to label each cluster on Y1.</li>
  <li>Apply Topic Modeling on X using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discover keywords from each cluster.</li>
  <li>Investigate the clusters visually on the plot, zooming down to specific articles as needed, and via classification using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).</li>  
</ul> 
<p>Total of <b>32,651 samples</b> analysed. Articles that are not English dropped.</p1>""")

CORD-19 is a resource of over 51,000 scholarly articles, including over 40,000 with full text, about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses. This freely available dataset is provided to the global research community to apply recent advances in natural language processing and other AI techniques to generate new insights in support of the ongoing fight against this infectious disease. There is a growing urgency for these approaches because of the rapid acceleration in new coronavirus literature, making it difficult for the medical research community to keep up.'</i> - Kaggle</p1>""")
